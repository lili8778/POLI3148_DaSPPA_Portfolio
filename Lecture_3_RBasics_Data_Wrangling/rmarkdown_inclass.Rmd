## R Markdown
## 123

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

## This is my level1 heading

### This is my level2 heading

#### This is my level3 heading

This is my main text

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
cars
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
